# with the exception of:

--maximum-line-length=0
# I think it is better to break lines manually (and yes, ideally to max 78 characters),
# When there are too many indent levels (nested blocks)
# it is better to refactor rather then auto-break lines.

--no-delete-old-newlines
# Sometimes I consider some statements (e.g. list expression) nicer to read when divided on more lines.

--no-outdent-labels
# In PBP there is no outdenting, but Conway forgot to add it to his perltidyrc

# From shell you can use the settings above with
# perltidy -pbp -l=0 -ndnl -nola
