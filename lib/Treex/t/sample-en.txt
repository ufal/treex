Barack Obama becomes the fourth American president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
The American president Barack Obama will fly into Oslo, Norway for 26 hours to receive the Nobel Peace Prize, the fourth American president in history to do so.
He will receive a diploma, medal and cheque for 1.4 million dollars for his exceptional efforts to improve global diplomacy and encourage international cooperation, amongst other things.
The head of the White House will be flying into the Norwegian city in the morning with his wife Michelle and will have a busy schedule.
First, he will visit the Nobel Institute, where he will have his first meeting with the five committee members who selected him from 172 people and 33 organisations.
The presidential couple then has a meeting scheduled with King Harald V and Queen Sonja of Norway.
Then, in the afternoon, the visit will culminate in a grand ceremony, at which Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He will be the fourth American president to be awarded the prize, and only the third to have received it while actually in office.
The White House has stated that, when he accepts the prize, Obama will speak about the war in Afghanistan.
The president does not want to skirt around this topic, as he realises that he is accepting the prize as a president whose country is currently at war in two countries.
