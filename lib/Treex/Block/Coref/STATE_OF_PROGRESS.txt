treex git repository:
    - branch "new_coref"
        * refactoring CR utilities
            - merging them with the utils for supervised alignment
            - therefore, both CR and Supervised Align scenario must be run to ensure that the funcionality did not change
            - almost no tests are written :(
            - run the following commands instead:

                    - testing if CR runs smoothly
                * qtl; cd repo/translate/cs-en/news; make translate eval D="testing Coref::CS::PersPron::Resolve - cs perspron CR refactored"
                  qtl; cd repo/translate/en-cs/news; make translate eval D="testing Coref::EN::PersPron::Resolve - en perspron CR refactored"
                    - testing Czech/English CR, if it produces the same results before and after the refactoring. See the branches 
                        "new_coref.before_large_refactoring.mt_test", "new_coref.en_persprons_refactored.mt_test", and "new_coref.cs_persprons_refactored.mt_test"
                * cd ~mnovak/projects/align_coref; treex -Len -Ssrc Read::Treex from=@data/gold_aligned.mgiza_on_czeng/dev.list Align::T::Supervised::PrintData align_language=cs node_types=all_anaph
                    - if the changes in CR do not affect supervised alignment
        * feature extractors
            - an abstract subclass Tool::ML::Ranker::Features (used to be a role but changed to enable/disable unary features prefixing)
            - unary features prefixing via the private attribute '_prefix_unary'
            - using augment and inner for '_unary_features' is a bit strange; not using it for '_binary_features'
            - TODO: a hierarchy of features extractors should be reconsidered, but it's not a toughest issue
        * node filtering
            - an attempt to unify to unify multiple node filters
            - some of them labelled as obsolete, but not deleted yet: Block::Eval::Coref, Tool::Coreference::CS::PronAnaphFilter,
                Tool::Coreference::CS::RelPronAnaphFilter, Tool::Coreference::EN::PronAnaphFilter,
                Tool::Coreference::Features::Distance, Tool::Coreference::Features::Morphological, Tool::Coreference::Features::TectoSyntax,
                Tool::Coreference::remove_PronCoref
            - using Tool::Coreference::NodeFilter to assign classes to nodes
            - the Block::Filter::Node role directly uses it to access only the [at]nodes that belong to one of the predefined classes:
                attribute 'node_types', a method 'process_filtered_[at]node' must be implemented
            - if the 'node_types' is used as a feature in some feature selector, the list must be filtered to rule out labels that has nothing
                to do with the feature selector, e.g. the constant %POSSIBLE_NODE_TYPES in Tool::Align::Features
        * ante cands getter
            - disposing of specialized sublasses for specific node types, e.g. NounAntesCandGetter
            - using only Tool::Coreference::AnteCandsGetter + the parameter 'cand_types' calling the Tool::Coreference::NodeFilter in the code
        * resolvers and printers
            - the same pattern as applied for supervised alignemnt, applied for CR (* is a role, => is 'with', --> is 'extends'), the same holds for CS and RelPron
                Block::Coref::PrintData       <--  EN::PersPron::PrintData
                       ||                               ||

                Block::Coref::Resolve         <--  EN::PersPron::Resolve
            - this has been tested on toy classes in (TO BE REMOVED):
                cec; cd skuska
            - old resolvers and printers removed: Block::A2T::BaseMarkCoref, Block::A2T::CS(EN)::MarkTextPronCoref, Block::Print::CorefData, Block::Print::CS(EN)::TextPronCorefData
            - TODO: move everything else that is not TreexCR to directory 'Treex::Block::Coref::External' or 'Treex::Block::Coref::Utils'

treex git repository:
    - branch "new_coref"
        * namespaces supported in VW formatter in Tool::ML::VowpalWabbit::Util
            - a new namespace is introduced by a feature whose key starts with the '|' symbol, its name following
            - Tool::ML::Ranker::Features transforms the features stored internally as hashes with keys following the pattern "ns^key" to the format accepted by the VW formatter
        * a wrapper around the CR feature selector put into Coref::SupervisedBase
            - it extracts node IDs, put it into comments section of the extended VW format and removes it from the feature set
        * CR scenario in Scen::Coref
            - able to resolve coreference up to the specified level
        * CR resolver for Czech relprons
        * simple evaluation of CR
            - Eval::Coref_new renamed to Coref::SimpleEval
            - adjusted to treat also the cases with a missing counterpart in the other selector
            - it is described in the commmit message #43e317cdb7
                - TODO: rewrite it into the PerlDoc of Coref::SimpleEval
        * align_coref_annot merged in
            - mostly due to the Filter::Node class unrestricted for the t-layer (it may be used for t, or a, or both the layers)
coref git repository:
    - branch "new_coref"
        * a CR training folder:
            - cec; cd treex_cr_train
            - inspired by "qtl; cd translate"
            - a training pipeline for the Czech relprons works out
            - TODO: continue for other types
        * a CR resolution folder
            - cec; cd treex_cr
            - performs the resolution up to the specified level
            - evaluates the spacified level
                - Coref::SimpleEval
                    - the overall number of instances coming from the dev test section in the treex_cr_train 
                      differ from the overall number of instances counted by Coref::SimpleEval. The reasons are the following:
                        * a true antecedent is filtered out:
                            - sempos=adj.denot, "pomoci postiženým, kteří nemají" (cmpr9415_035.streex##4.t_tree-cs_src-s4-n290)

                - conll_scorer put on hold until Coref::PrepareSpecializedEval is fixed, or used for all the mentions
            - shows the results in a pretty-print colored format
            - TODO: print the scores to the final result table logging all the runs
MLyn git repository:
    - branch "master"
        * ML Framework extracted from the tectomt git-svn repository and renamed to MLyn
