=head1 NAME

Treex::Block::W2A::TokenizeOnWhitespace - Base tokenizer, splits on whitespaces, fills no_space_after

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Each sentence is split into a sequence of tokens.
Flat a-tree is built and attributes C<no_space_after> are filled.
This class tokenizes only on whitespaces,
but it can be used as an ancestor for more apropriate tokenization
by overriding the method C<tokenize_sentence>.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item tokenize_sentence()

this method can be overridden in more advanced tokenizers

=item process_zone()

this method does all work of this tokenizer
