=head1 NAME

Treex::Block::A2T::ES::SetCoapFunctors

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Functors (attribute C<functor>) in t-trees
have to be assigned in (at least) two phases. This block
corresponds to the first phase, in which only coordination and apposition functors
are filled (which makes it possible to use the notions of effective parents and effective
children in the following phase).
