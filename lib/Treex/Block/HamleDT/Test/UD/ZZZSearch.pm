=item Treex::Block::HamleDT::Test::UD::ZZZSearch

A temporary block to search a phenomenon and browse it in the same fashion as test errors.
It will be changed every time one wants to start a new investigation.
We probably do not want to commit the changes to the svn repository.
But we must make sure that a block with this name exists, even if it is empty,
because it will be called from the Makefile.
