=head1 NAME

Treex::Core::Phrase::Builder

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A C<Builder> provides methods to construct a phrase structure tree around
a dependency tree. It takes a C<Node> and returns a C<Phrase>.

The tree of phrases is constructed bottom-up and after every new nonterminal
phrase is created, the method C<detect_special_constructions()> is called.
It is empty by default but derived classes may use it to implement detection
of special phrase types in particular annotation styles, such as the Prague-style
coordination. See C<Treex::Tool::PhraseBuilder> for an example.

=head1 METHODS

=over

=item build

Wraps a node (and its subtree, if any) in a phrase.

=item detect_special_constructions

Takes a phrase and returns either the same phrase, or a new phrase that should
replace it.

Examines a nonterminal phrase and tries to recognize certain special phrase
types. This part will be different for different builders. It depends both on
the expected input style and the desired output style. This method is always
called after a new nonterminal phrase is built. It can be defined as empty if
the builder does not do anything special.
