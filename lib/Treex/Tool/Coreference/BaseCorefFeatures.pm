=head1 NAME 

Treex::Tool::Coreference::BaseCorefFeatures

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A role for coreference features, encapsulating unary features related to 
the anaphor (candidate), antecedent candidates' as well as binary features
related to both participants of the coreference relation. If generalized more,
this role might serve as an interface to features of any binary (or binarized) 
relation.

=head1 PARAMETERS

=over

=item feature_names

Names of features that should be used for training/resolution. This list is, 
however, not obeyed inside this class. Method C<create_instances> returns all 
features that are extracted here, providing no filtering. It is a job of the 
calling method to decide whether to check the returned instances if they comply 
with the required list of features and possibly filter them.

=item format

Temporary parameter. Being assigned to one of the values C<percep> or C<unsup>, it
determines the format of a hash returned by method C<create_instances>. 

If set to C<percep> (default), the returned hash of instances is indexed by ids 
of antecedent candidates and every instance besides binary and candidate
unary features contains also anaphor unary features.

If set to C<unsup>, the returned hash of instances is on the first level divided
into  two sections, indexed by labels C<cands> and C<anaph>. The structure of the 
C<cands> section is almost the same as in the C<percep> format, just with no anaphor 
unary features included. These are stored just once in the C<anaph> section.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 To be implemented

These methods must be implemented in classes that consume this role.

=over

=item _build_feature_names 

A list of features required for training/resolution.

=item _unary_features

It returns a hash of unary features that relate either to the anaphor or the
antecedent candidate.

=item _binary_features 

It returns a hash of binary features that combine both the anaphor and the
antecedent candidate.

=back

=head2 Already implemented

=over

=item anaph_feature_names

Names of features describing the anaphor (anaphor unary features).

=item nonanaph_feature_names

Names of features describing the antecedent candidate and both
the antecedent candidate and the anaphor (the union of binary and
anaphor unary features).

=item extract_anaph_features

Extracts the features describing the anaphor (anaphor unary features).

=item extract_nonanaph_features

Extracts the features describing the antecedent candidate and both
the antecedent candidate and the anaphor (the union of binary and
anaphor unary features).

=item create_instances

Returns a list of instances corresponding to antecedent candidates,
where the structure of extracted features is determined by parameter
C<format>.


=item init_doc_features

Some features require the scope of the whole document, not just the
current anaphor - antecedent candidate couple. This method provides
a place to initialize and precompute the data necessary for 
document-scope features.

Currently, method C<init_doc_features_from_trees> for language-selector
corresponding tectogrammatical trees is called.

=item init_doc_features_from_trees

The same as C<init_doc_features> method, just differs in the scope
- in this case the list of tectogrammatical trees.

Currently, in this init stage, the clause and sentence numbers 
within the whole document (or CzEng block) are set.

=item _categorize

Quantization of continuous variables into intervals.

=item _join_feats 

Produces a feature, which is a concatenation of two features.

=item _agree_feats 

Produces a feature, which is an indicator of equality of two features.
