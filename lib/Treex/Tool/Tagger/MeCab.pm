=head1 NAME

Treex::Tool::Tagger::MeCab - perl wrapper for C implemented japanese morphological analyzer MeCab

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Treex::Tool::Tagger::MeCab;
 my $tagger = Treex::Tool::Tagger::MeCab->new();
 my $sentence = qw(わたしは日本語を話します);
 my @tokens = $tagger->process_sentence($sentence);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a Perl wrapper for MeCab tagger and tokenizer implemented in C++.
Generates string of features (first one is wordform) for each token generated. Returns array of tokens for further use.

=head1 INSTALLATION

Before installing MeCab, make sure you have properly installed the Treex-Core package (see L<Treex Installation|http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/treex/install.html>), since it is prerequisite for this module anyway.
After installing Treex-Core you can install MeCab using this L<Makefile|https://svn.ms.mff.cuni.cz/svn/tectomt_devel/trunk/install/tool_installation/MeCab/Makefile> (username "public" passwd "public"). Prior to runing the makefile, you must set the enviromental variable "$TMT_ROOT" to the location of your .treex directory.

You can also install MeCab manually but then you must link the installation directory to the ${TMT_ROOT}/share/installed_tools/tagger/MeCab/ (location within Treex share), otherwise the modules will not be able to use the program.

=head1 METHODS

=item @tokens = $tagger->process_sentence($sentence);

Returns list of "tokens" for the tokenized input with its morphological categories each separated by \t.
