=head1 NAME

Treex::Tool::PhraseBuilder::BasePhraseBuilder

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Derived from C<Treex::Core::Phrase::Builder>, this class implements language-
and treebank-specific phrase structures. However, it is itself intended as the
base for more specific phrase builders. A specific builder will do just one
type of treebank conversion. It will expect input dependencies from one
particular annotation style (e.g. the Prague style, the AnCora style etc.)
Optionally it may expect that the dependency labels are converted to a
particular label set (dialect), which may or may not be affected by the target
annotation style. Finally, some phrase builders may perform phrase operations
that are motivated by both the source and the target style (and the differences
between them).

Transformations organized bottom-up during phrase building are advantageous
because we can rely on that all special structures (such as coordination) on the
lower levels have been detected and treated properly so that we will not
accidentially destroy them.

The C<BasePhraseBuilder> provides methods that the more specific classes may
find useful. However, it does not specify which methods will be used, not even
as a default. If this class is used directly to build the phrase structure, no
special phrase types will be detected.

=head1 METHODS

=over

=item build

Wraps a node (and its subtree, if any) in a phrase.

=item detect_prague_pp

Examines a nonterminal phrase in the Prague style. If it recognizes
a prepositional phrase, transforms the general nonterminal to PP.
Returns the resulting phrase (if nothing has been changed, returns
the original phrase).

=item detect_prague_coordination

Examines a nonterminal phrase in the Prague style (with analytical functions
converted to dependency relation labels based on Universal Dependencies). If
it recognizes a coordination, transforms the general NTerm to Coordination.
