=head1 NAME

Treex::Tool::PhraseBuilder::UDToPrague

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Derived from C<Treex::Core::Phrase::Builder>, this class implements language-
and treebank-specific phrase structures.

It expects that the dependency relation labels have been translated to the
Prague dialect. The expected tree structure is Universal Dependencies, i.e.
Stanford-style coordination and function words (such as preposition and copula)
are dependents everywhere. The target style is Prague.

=head1 METHODS

=over

=item build

Wraps a node (and its subtree, if any) in a phrase.
