=head1 NAME

Treex::Tool::PhraseBuilder::MoscowToPrague

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Derived from C<Treex::Core::Phrase::Builder>, this class implements language-
and treebank-specific phrase structures.

It expects that the dependency relation labels have been translated to the
Prague dialect. The expected tree structure features Moscow coordination
and prepositional phrases with the function marked at the head preposition.
The target style is Prague.

Input treebanks for which this builder should work include Tiger (German).

=head1 METHODS
