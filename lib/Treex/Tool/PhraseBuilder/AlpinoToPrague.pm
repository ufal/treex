=head1 NAME

Treex::Tool::PhraseBuilder::AlpinoToPrague

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Derived from C<Treex::Core::Phrase::Builder>, this class implements language-
and treebank-specific phrase structures.

It expects that the dependency relation labels have been translated to the
Prague dialect. The expected tree structure features Alpino coordination
(same shape as Prague but the relation between coordination and its parent is
stored at the coordination head)
and prepositional phrases with the function marked at the head preposition.
The target style is Prague.

Input treebanks for which this builder should work include Alpino (Dutch) and
the Penn Treebank (English) converted for the CoNLL 2007 shared task.
