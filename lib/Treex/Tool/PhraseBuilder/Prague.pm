=head1 NAME

Treex::Tool::PhraseBuilder::Prague

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Derived from C<Treex::Core::Phrase::Builder>, this class implements language-
and treebank-specific phrase structures.

There are methods that detect structures in a Prague-style treebank (such as
the Czech Prague Dependency Treebank).

Transformations organized bottom-up during phrase building are advantageous
because we can rely on that all special structures (such as coordination) on the
lower levels have been detected and treated properly so that we will not
accidentially destroy them.

=head1 METHODS

=over

=item build

Wraps a node (and its subtree, if any) in a phrase.
