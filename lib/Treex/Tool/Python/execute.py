"""
Execute commands given on STDIN, print their output to STDOUT.

Waits for "print '<<<<END>>>>'\n" on a single line to execute the
commands read from STDIN. If this occurs, the commands are executed
and their output, including "<<<<END>>>>", is returned immediately.

This is designed to work with the Treex::Tool::Python::RunFunc
module.
