=head1 NAME

Treex::Tool::ML::Ranker

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Role for rankers. Every ML method which ranks instances should implement this
role. This role is not meant just for coreference.

=head1 PARAMETERS

=over

=item C<model_path>

A path to the trained model for ranker.

=back

=head1 METHODS

=over

=item C<pick_winner>

Based on the ranking of candidates returned from the method C<rank>, this
method picks and returns a candidate with the highest score and the score as the second item of the output.
Input parameter is a hash of candidates indexed by their ids.

=back

=head1 REQUIRED METHODS

=over

=item C<_build_model>

A private model constructor. Its implementation should build and return a
in-memory representation of the model as a reference to a hash indexed by
strings. The model can be loaded from the C<model_path> file.

=item C<rank>

This method receives a hash of candidates indexed by their ids. They should be
ranked and the result must be a hash with scores indexed by candidates' ids.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  package Treex::Tool::Coreference::PerceptronRanker;
